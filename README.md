<b>7. GMGridView</b>

This little grid view library allows for the simple creation of highly interaction view sets. You can see a nice video of an example result here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK-qULlvAv4. https://github.com/gmoledina/GMGridView


<b>6. PRTween</b>

PRTween is an extension of the core animation framework. It is an effort to take the power of core animation, and make it easier to use. The commands available may remind some of the stupid-simple jQuery animation commands like fade, hide, or show. https://github.com/dominikhofmann/PRTween

<b>5. iHasApp</b>

I recently was asked by a client if we could detect their other apps installed on the device, and if the user didn’t own them if we could have the app present cross-promotional ads. I wasn’t sure what the answer to their question was, it seemed like something that might fall under the dreaded “private api” category. But here this project is an App Store friendly library to detect other apps installed on the user’s phone. https://github.com/danielamitay/iHasAppb

<b>4. NUI</b>

NUI is a very interesting project that aims to make styling of iOS apps as easy as styling in CSS. Take a look at the syntax on the project’s github page and you’ll see what makes this such an interesting project. https://github.com/tombenner/nui

<b>3. grabKit</b>

If you are writing an iPhone app that involves the user’s photos, one thing that’s always a bit tricky is adding support for all the various social networks that the user might prefer to host their photos on. grabKit makes this easier with this drop-in library that let’s the user import photos from Facebook, Flickr, Instagram, Picasa, or the iOS device itself. https://github.com/pierrotsmnrd/grabKit

<b>2. MultistrokeGestureRecognizer</b>

This library is great for anyone creating a very touch-centric game, or any app that uses lots of complex gestures. The library is based on the N Multistroke Recognizer which is a great algorithm for detecting very complex touch gestures. If you remember the gestures in the game Black & White, it’s kind of like that. https://github.com/britg/MultistrokeGestureRecognizer-iOS

<b>1. Filepicker</b>

Similar to grabKit, Filepicker allows for the importing of files from various social networks, but also includes many more services such as Dropbox, Gmail, and even Github. The library is also not limited to only photos but can be used for a range of content types. https://github.com/Filepicker/ios
